# Initial Indie Hacker Repo

---

_This repo marks the start of my indie hacker journey. A reminder to myself: I began, and I won’t stop._

## Vision

BinaryBurning is my proving ground — a space for experiments, artifacts, and indie tools that may evolve into SaaS projects.

## Planned Projects

This monorepo will grow into multiple labs and experiments:

- **/terraform** → Infrastructure as Code experiments with AWS
- **/aws-cli** → Scripts and notes for AWS CLI workflows
- **/security+** → Study artifacts and security practice configs
- **/indie-tools** → Micro‑projects, utilities, and creative experiments
- **/DocXfer** → Potential SaaS project (status: TBD)
